Hi,

This is a small side project that I'm doing while doing my regular class.
The objective of the project is to graph the whole of Wikipedia.
The code itself in main branch *should* work in a more simple way (I did last time I tried it ^-^') as it will just use .cvs as outputs.

I'm currently trying to add savepoints in the code so that I don't have to rerun everything everytime it fails. (^-^')> 
If you want to propose some help please say so.

You'll need a running MySQL DB and to make a small .env file in your repo to store the values for host, user, password and database that you use.
Also you'll need to use any software that use .cvs for rendering the graph (Gephi, for exemple).
